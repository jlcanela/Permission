# Documentation

__Disclaimer__:â€¯The author of this document is not a professional security practitionner. 

The architecture and proposed solution can only be considered as an illustration of common security practices.

## Context

This is a public Merchant website where an anonymous customer can add items to a cart. When he orders he have to fulfill the delivery address and then issue the payment. Once the payment is received the order is sent by mail.

## Architecture

The proposed architecture is a "Single Page Application" accessible on internet.   

### Initial Architecture

The Customer access the "Single Page Application" using a web browser. The access is anonymous. The application connects to a backend, the backend store the data in a database.

The simplified diagram:
```mermaid
C4Dynamic
title Diagram for a simplified Merchant Website

Person(customer, "Customer")

Container(spa, "Single-Page Application", "JavaScript and Angular", "Provides all of the Internet banking functionality to customers via their web browser.")

Container_Boundary(website, "Merchant Website") {

    Container(backend, "Backend", "NodeJS or C#", "Provides all the features.")

    ContainerDb(database, "Database", "Relational Database Schema", "Stores user registration information, hashed authentication credentials, access logs, etc.")
}
Rel_U(customer, spa, "Uses", "https")
Rel_U(spa, backend, "Connects", "https")
Rel_U(backend, database, "Uses", "postgres")
```

### Initial Feedback 

The initial architecture does not take into account the context of the business. Using a "single page application" and "database" technical concepts are not enough to determine who are the various stakeholders nor what do they need to do. Once the "Work" is defined itâ€™s easier to determine how the Merchant Website can developed and describe the components and their relationship.

#### Starting from the customer

The customer need to browse the available products, select them in a cart, fulfill the delivery address and pay. 

```mermaid

    subgraph 'Online Shopping Use Cases'
    uc1((Browse Products))
    uc2((Select Items in Cart))
    uc3((Issue Order))
    uc4((Fulfill delivery address))
    uc5((Pay Order))
    end
    customer[CustomerðŸ‘¤]

    customer-->uc1
    customer-->uc2
    customer-->uc3
    uc3-. include .->uc4
    uc3-. include .->uc5
```

A data flow diagram (__DFD__) maps out the flow of information for any process or system. 

They are very useful to describe the business cases:

## Securing the Merchant Website 

Defense in depth principles are enforced at all the OSIâ€¯levels. 

### Session Layer

When the merchant application first connects to the Merchant website, a unique intemperable session identifier is provided by the API Gateway. The session identifier is a JWT provided by the identity provider. 

he JWT is systematically verified by the API Gateway and no traffic without session identifier is allowed after this component. 

### Presentation Layer 

This layer consists of formatting, conversion, translation and encryption. 
All this processing is done inside the SPAâ€¯Merchant Application. 

### Application Layer 

The real work is executed in the services ecosystem, deep inside the merchant platform. 
Strict security policies are defined and enforced. 

The common identified risks are 
* Confidentiality
  * risk: product search and cart content could allow inference of sensitive data (genre, sickness, pregnancy)
  * mitigation:â€¯https is enforced
* Integrity
  * risk: cart could be updated by another user, order delivery address could be updated by another user
  * mitigation: access to all cart / order data is restricted by session identifier
- Availability
  * risk: all APIs being accessible via internet, a denial of service is possible
  * mitigation: the WAF and API Gateway limit APIâ€¯calls related to a same abusing client IP Address, client session or identified attack pattern
- Auditability
  * risk: abuse could not be properly attributed to an attacker
  * mitigation: IP address, session information, API calls are properly logged, logs are encrypted and not accessible except by authorize personal and legitimate use according to GDPR / CCAP

#### Product Service

No additionnal risk identified for Customer access. 

#### Cart Service

No additional risk identified for Customer access

#### Order Service

No addtional risk identified for Customer access

#### Payment Service

Payment service risk is delegated to third party provider. Due diligence is to be applied during the provider selection process. 

Additional "non payment" risk should be properly investigated, quantified and mitigated. 

## Security Policies

The Security Policies are the following. 

### Search Product

There is no limitation in the search product. 
A "pass-through" policy is netherveless defined. 

An alternative is to limit the product search to requests having a session identifier.

```
// allow search to product
@id("ProductSearch.session")
permit (
  principal,
  action in
    [OnlineStore::Action::"searchProduct"],
  resource
)
when { context has sessionId };
```

### Create Cart

The only limitation to cart creation is the existence of a session identifier. 

```
// allow create cart
@id("CartCreate.session")
permit (
  principal,
  action in
    [OnlineStore::Action::"createCart"],
  resource
)
when { context has sessionId };
```

### Add / Remove / Update Cart

The cart Add / Remove / Update access is limited to the session which have created the cart initially. 

```
// allow add / remove / update cart
@id("CartAddRemoveUpdate")
permit (
  principal,
  action in
    [OnlineStore::Action::"createCart"],
  resource
)
when { context has sessionId && resource has sessionId && context.sessionId == resource.sessionId };
```

### Issue Order

The issue order is limited to the session which have created the cart initially.

```
```

### Fulfill Delivery Address

The fulfill delivery address is limited to the session which have created the cart initially.

```
```

### Confirm Order

The confirm order is limited to the payment system. 

```
```

It is assumed that the business rule "Payment Request correspond to the Payment Confirmation" is properly verified by the Order Service. As it is a business rule it is not enforced by the permission system. 

### Request Payment

The request payment is implemented by a third party.

It is assumed that a proper authentication process is defined and security controls are enforced. A security policy is out of scope for this service.
